## Why

This blog is mainly made for me to write about all my experiments. I think it's always good to document everything and sharing it publicly means that if a reader find a mistake it can contribute back.

## How is this blog hosted

This was hosted on many different hardware :
 * A Seagate Dockstar at home for more than two years.
 * A VPS from 1&1 for a couple of years also.
 * A VPS from Pulseheberg for a long time.
 * Netlify since december 2017.
