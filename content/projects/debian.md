# Debian

## Why
I use Linux since 1998, I started, like a lot of people, with Red Hat. In 2002, I installed my first Woody and Debian never deceived me since. I tried, some years ago, Ubuntu but I stay faithful to Debian.

## How can I use it

Beside of the classic desktop use, I had many dedicated usage of Debian :

* Personnal PVR with VDR and a full featured DVB-S card.
* Divx Box.
* Web server.
* General purpose server.
* ...
