# How to install a new dictionnary in TortoiseSVN without installing the language pack

## Why ?

I'm french but I'm so used to the english interface that I don't wan't to install the french language pack. But I like my commit messages to be easy to read so a spell checker is welcome.

## How ?

Follow this link : http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/nightly/TortoiseSVN_fr/tsvn-intro-install-spell.html.

I had to change the dictionnary file I got from Firefox from fr.aff to fr_FR.aff to make it work.
