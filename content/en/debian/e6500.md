# Dell Latitude E6500

It's a great laptop which is installed with Vista or XP. Of course I tried to install a 64bits Lenny just to see. Here are some information about it :

# 5/18/2009 First try : Lenny

## What's good
There is quite a lot of things running out of the box :

*	cpufreq (with the ondemand governor)
*	gigabit network
*	USB

So you've guessed, there a lot of major thing missing.

## Xorg

This laptop has a GM45 Express Chipset (also know as GMA 4500MHD). With Xorg autodetection the 1920x1200 screen was not correctly detected and checking the log, I was using the VESA driver. I had to modify my xorg.conf to have it working :

```
Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Configured Video Device"
	Driver          "intel"
EndSection
```

I'm currently not happy about my 2D performance (iceweasel/firefox is still a lot slower comparing to Windows), I'm still testing.

## Wifi

Two problems here :

*	the firmware is not free (so not included in debian)
*	the driver is only available in recent kernel

So follow this [howto](http://wiki.debian.org/iwlagn) and you should be all right (beware of installing the correct kernel : amd64 in my case). I recommend using [wicd](http://wicd.sourceforge.net/) to configure your wifi.

## Audio

This laptop uses the snd-hda-intel driver and when you try any sound you hear the same tone repeated 5 or 6 times .... not great
I followed this [post](http://junisesafvanishere.blogspot.com/2009/02/intel-corporation-82801i-ich9-family-hd.html) and got it working.

## Conclusion

I'm sorry (and sad) to say that Debian is not ready for some average joe and any uptodate computer because you need :

*	to be willing to search to have everything working.
*	to be willing to wait a long time to have very good driver : the latest intel driver (available in the latest ubuntu) come with the UXA acceleration method which brings a lot of performance.
*	to accept that running a debian means getting your hands dirty each time you have a firmware to install.

Anyway I'm pretty amazed by this laptop, it runs really good.
# June 2009 Second try : Lenny and a little bit of Sid

I tried using the xorg driver of sid and the 2D performance was perfect (sufficient for my needs).
# January 2010 Third try : Squeeze

## What's good
Well there is not too much to say as everything seems to work as expected out of the box (wifi, webcam, ...). The only thing I'm still waiting for is hardware decoding of H264 it should happen during the first semester of 2011.

## Conclusion

When you're patient enough, everything is all right.
