# Installation of Xorg

## Prerequisites
Starting with version 7.3, Xorg detect better your hardware and so it is not mandatory anymore to reconfigure the package xserver-xorg if good tools are installed

```
apt-get install mdetect read-edid hwinfo discover xdebconfigurator
```

## Installation of Xorg

Thanks to Debian, it's really easy :

```
apt-get install xorg
```

Eventually, you can reconfigure it with that command :

```
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
```

## Manual modification of Xorg.conf

The configuration file of Xorg is /etc/X11/Xorg.conf (beware of the case)

```
# xorg.conf (X.Org X Window System server configuration file)
#
# This file was generated by dexconf, the Debian X Configuration tool, using
# values from the debconf database.
#
# Edit this file with caution, and see the xorg.conf manual page.
# (Type "man xorg.conf" at the shell prompt.)
#
# This file is automatically updated on xserver-xorg package upgrades *only*
# if it has not been modified since the last upgrade of the xserver-xorg
# package.
#
# If you have edited this file but would like it to be automatically updated
# again, run the following command:
#   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg

        EndSubSection
EndSection
```

I have a video card with two VGA output. I currently have one screen on VGA-1. To make it work properly (XV video for example) I had to disable VGA-0. My screen frequencies are also not detected, I was forced to help Xorg by giving HorizSync and VertRefresh.

# Installation of XFCE

[XFCE](http://www.xfce.org) is a window manager. It is very light and clean, it's base on GTK2 which give it a customisable look.
It's also easy to install :

```
apt-get install xfce4
```

All we need to do is to test it by logging as a normal user and to type :

```
startx
```

# Installation of a Display Manager (DM)

## Many choices
For now, our Lenny should start in text mode and we can and we can start the GUI with startx. It's also possible to log on with a GUI, you'll nee a Display Manager. there are a lot :

*	gdm : linked to Gnome, that's why I don't use it (a lot of dependencies).
*	kdm : linked to KDE.
*	xdm : not a lot of dependencies but not very pretty.
*	wdm : ditto

## Installation of SLiM

I'll then install an other one : [SLiM](http://slim.berlios.de/) : 

```
apt-get install slim
```

Everything is then already done. You can log on graphically (CTRL + ALT + F7 if the console hasn't changed automatically).
